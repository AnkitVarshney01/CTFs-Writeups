Oh no! A hacker has stolen a flag from us and is holding it ransom. Can you help us figure out who created this document? Find their email address and demand 
they return the flag!

## Solution
In this challenges as we open the doc there is a message. Our aim is to find out who is the owner of the document, so I shared the document by clicking on the blue button
on the top right side. The sharing mail in mine inbox shown the name of owner to be amy.

So I tried the email amy.sdctf@gmail.com and I got the flag.

```
Flag : sdctf{0p3n_S0uRCE_1S_aMaz1NG}
```
