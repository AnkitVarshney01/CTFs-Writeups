# Blue Lagoon

Forgot to write the question, we are given with these two images which the friend of author has sent, describing the island where she went as *one of the best places to be*.
We need to find out the place.

## Solution

Reverse searching both the images will get us the name of them, one of them is image name as well. gyr falcon and artic term, both are found
in north american side islands. Google reverse image search of falcon will lead us to https://wildlifeiceland.is/in-gyr-falcon-country/ which
will tell us the photograph is courtesy of Birdlife Icelandm which is in Reykjav√≠k, capital of iceland. The other photo shows some images in
the bg, on google lensing those images, https://flatey.com/frettir/ is where we'll come, flatey. Now this is another island in iceland. The
bluelagoon is another geothermal spa in iceland.
